"""Spark Configuration

In this file we define the key configuration parameters for submitting Spark jobs. Spark can be run
in a variety of deployment contexts. See the Spark documentation at
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html for a more in-depth summary of
Spark deployment contexts and configuration.
